            <p>In the 1970s, personal computers becam more and more popular. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak showcased the first Apple II. The Apple II boasted built-in BASIC programming language, color graphics, and a 4100 character memory for only $1298. Up until the 1980s, there was no graphical user interface, this meant computers were still somewhat difficult to use. This changed in 1984 when apple released the Macintosh, which was the first computer to come with a graphical user interface(GUI) and a mouse. The GUI made the machine much more attractive to home computer users because it was easy to use. Other companies followed suit and sales of personal computers soared. Personal computers continued to develop in speed and userbility up to wher they are today. The average computer a person might have in their home is more powerful by several orders of magnitude than a machine like ENIAC.</p>

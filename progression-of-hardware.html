            <p>In the 1950s, the transistor was invented. This replaced the vacuum tubes that were widely used in computers at the time. The transistors produced much less heat than the vacuum tubes. This meant the costs of running a computer was reduced. Transistors, however, had their problems too. The main problem was that transistors, like other electronic components, needed to be soldered together. As a result, the more complex the circuits became, the more complicated and numerous the connections between the individual transistors and the likelihood of faulty wiring increased. This problem was solved in 1958 by the invention of the integrated circuit or chip. A chip is really a collection of tiny transistors which are connected together when the transistor is manufactured. Thus, the need for soldering together large numbers of transistors was practically nullified; now only connections were needed to other electronic components. In addition to saving space, the speed of the machine was now increased since there was a diminished distance that the electrons had to follow.</p>

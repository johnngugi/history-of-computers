            <p>The first electronic computers, invented in the 1940s, used electronic switches and vacuum tubes to store data. The vacuum tubes could only store about 32 to 512 bytes therefore thousands of these tubes were recquired for these computers to be useful. This meant that the first electronic computers were huge and would recquire lots of space.The first substantial computer was the giant ENIAC machine by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania. ENIAC used nearly 1800 vacuum tubes.  Storage of all those vacuum tubes and the machinery required to keep the cool took up over 167 square meters of floor space. ENIAC used punch card input and output.The  first electronic computers used a lot of electricity, had many moving parts, therefore they brokedown oftenly, used up a lot of space and could only be used by highly trained people. Despite this they were very useful especially in the military world. A calculation that would take a human several hours to complete would take a computer several seconds</p>
